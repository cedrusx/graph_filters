# graph_filters
MATLAB code for FIR and IIR graph filters described in this paper:
[Infinite Impulse Response Graph Filters in Wireless Sensor Networks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7001054/)

The code was developed in 2014 and has not been updated since then. The main_*.m scripts were for producing figures in the paper, but perhaps were not exactly the published version.
